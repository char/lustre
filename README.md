# Comet

An opinionated, "batteries included" ASGI web framework on top of [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/).

## Roadmap

- **Database support + ORM**
- Proper, `.env` and environment variable configuration (we get this for free with Starlette)
- Proper, nice, logging support
- Potentially support 'freezing' a site into a static bundle - Pre-render templates, turn redirects into nginx configuration, et cetera.
